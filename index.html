        <h1>Welcome to Crypto Beach</h1>
        <p>The year is 2019. Miami is the heart of the crypto revolution and is now known as “Crypto Beach.” Who will make it to the moon, and who will hold the bag? It is a game of brinkmanship, FOMO, and scheming; each round has escalating stakes and corresponding risks.</p>
        <p>Your goal is to get as many coins into your cold wallet as possible before the bubble pops and the last round ends. You can use and abuse the mechanics of cryptocurrency mining, decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs), and crypto smart contracts.</p>

        <h1>What?</h1>
        <p>Crypto Beach is a board game inspired by the enthusiasm, madness, and joy of crypto. It’s easy to just make fun of crypto, but there is something special about the optimism, fun, and sense of community. The whole fraud and pyramid scheme thing isn’t great though.</p>
        <p>A lot of the fun of crypto is watching it reinvent or rediscover things about finance. Crypto Beach hopes to bring that energy to a board game: this game is about reinventing or rediscovering things about game theory (and swindling your friends).</p>
